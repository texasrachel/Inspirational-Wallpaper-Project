Use flex grid

Responsive Web Design

Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. For even more control within a flexible layout, you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.

Not recommended?:
/* size info from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp */

/* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  div {font-size: 20px;}}

/* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  div {font-size: 30px;}}

/* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  div {font-size: 40px;}}

/* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {
  div {font-size: 50px;}}

/* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  div {font-size: 60px;}}

@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  orientation {background-color: #0000ff;}}
