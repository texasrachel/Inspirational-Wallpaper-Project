# Project/App Title: 
Motivational Wallpaper

## Project/App Description:
This app will be made for mobile users. It will take a random quote and output a "prettified" wallpaper. The quote from the API will be turned into decorative text. Then it will overlay the quote on a colored background.

## API:
[ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/)

ZenQuotes allows 3 API calls/30 seconds

## API Snippet:
```{
[
  {
    "q": "Be where your enemy is not.",
    "a": "Sun Tzu",
    "h": "<blockquote>&ldquo;Be where your enemy is not.&rdquo; &mdash; <footer>Sun Tzu</footer></blockquote>"
  },
  {
    "q": "Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.",
    "a": "Sun Tzu",
    "h": "<blockquote>&ldquo;Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.&rdquo; &mdash; <footer>Sun Tzu</footer></blockquote>"
